Hello, my name is Viktor ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate software engineer interested in Python, Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, Software Architecture, and tons of other stuff.
This is where I dump my various learnings and musings to solidify my knowledge and help out my pea brain a little ðŸ«›

Aside from coding, I love playing and writing music, mostly hitting drums with drumsticks or playing my guitar :material-music:
